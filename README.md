## goals

- Simple consumer app streaming your senses (vision, audio, etc.) to the cloud using wearables and sensors
- Make it easy to search through and process (e.g. when did i see bob, how many cats did i see in feb, what seems to be my purpose of life based on my actions, etc.)

## how to:
1. git clone
2. open with xcode
3. setup your supabase project, create a bucket "remember" public, full row policy access, put url and supabase key in ios/Noa/Noa/APIKey.swift
4. run on your iphone
5. wear monocle and go for a walking conversation with your friend, and never lose this memory
